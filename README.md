Your Ultimate Smart Vocab Bot (V2.0)
====================================

Yo! Let’s be real—learning English words is easy, but remembering them? That’s the hard part. Most of us just hoard lists of words in our notes and never look at them again.

That's why I built this bot. It’s a Smart Learning Assistant that lives in your Telegram and forces you to actually learn, using science and some cool tech.

 The Science: Spaced Repetition
--------------------------------

The bot uses a Weighted Selection System (a lite version of Spaced Repetition).

New words (Level 1) are like toddlers; they need constant attention. The bot picks them 10 times more often.

Mastered words (Level 5) are the pros. They only pop up occasionally to make sure you haven't forgotten them.

 What’s Under the Hood?
-------------------------

-  Auto-Magic Translation: No need to type the meaning in your sheet. The bot uses Google’s translation engine to give you the meaning in your native language on the fly.
-  Native Voice: It fetches high-quality audio from the Dictionary API so you can hear exactly how the word is pronounced.
-  YouGlish Integration (The Game Changer): With one click, it opens a YouGlish search for that specific word, showing you real-life YouTube clips of native speakers using it.
-  Contextual Learning: It shows the word inside a real sentence (from your sheet) and fetches a formal English definition from a pro dictionary.
-  One-Tap Management: Use interactive buttons to mark words as "Done", "Later", or just "Delete" them if they're too easy.
